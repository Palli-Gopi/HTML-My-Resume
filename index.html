            <li><strong>Online Surver Systems</strong>
                <p>March 2021 - July 2021</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Online Survey System Project is a web-based
                    application developed in Java programming language
                    to facilitate an online survey. The main aim of the
                    project is to form a platform to collect the viewpoints
                    of related people about certain issues using the
                    internet.

            <li><strong>Fast Food Billing System(FOOODDIEEE)</strong>
                <p>July 2021 - December 2021</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A billing system can be very useful in a business
                        environment. Instead of making bills manually or to
                        sum up the total manually, Ideally, users should be
                        able to generate bills without any mistakes and
                        quickly, enabling them to speed up or improve their
                        process. To overcome this problem, we have come up
                        with this project, which is a restaurant billing system
                        using a Python domain.
                    </li>
                    <li>Role: | designed the frontend for this project by
                        using HTML coding.

            <li><strong>Smart Car Parking System</strong>
                <p>December 2021 - June 2022</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The demand for smart parking systems is increasing
                        significantly. This allows the user to have real-time
                        access to the availability of the parking space. The
                        existing system was a vision-based monitoring
                        system [7], which estimated the number of parking
                        slots available in the area by counting the number of
                        incoming and outgoing cars, which consumed a lot of
                        time and effort.
                    </li>
                    <li>My role on this project is gathering requirements</li>

            <li><strong>Smart Signaling Using Image Processing</strong>
                <p>July 2022 - April 2023</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vehicles are recognized by the system by clicking on
                        images rather than by electrical sensors. A camera is
                        installed next to the traffic light. Take pictures
                        continuously. Image processing is a great way to
                        control the changing state of traffic lights. This not
                        only reduces traffic congestion but also reduces the
                        time wasted on green lights on empty roads
